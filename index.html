			<h2>Pro Dev Activities</h2>

			<h3>Quantitative Accomplishments:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Monthly sales topped $50,000
				</li>
				<li>
					Spoken in front of crowds larger than 1,500
				</li>
				<li>
					Overseen the repair of 1000+ vehicles.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Qualitative features:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Detail Oriented:</strong> This can be a positive feature because it ensures that not even the smallest
					detail is overlooked, which can be very helpful. It can also be the cause of delays as the need
					to make things as good as possible sets in and it becomes difficult to leave something alone.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Thinker:</strong> This quality is useful because it helps me become aware of and be prepared for any
					issues that may arise. That can lead to a higher quality of work done. There can be a negative to this feature.
					In thinking too much, I have found that the more time I spend in preparation the later I get started on the rest of
					the project.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Friendly/Nice:</strong> This feature is a good one to have because it makes networking and making friends
					easier. I find it very easy to meet and talk to new people and that is a very good trait to have in this or any
					industry. Being too nice comes with some disadvantages.  I find it difficult to say no to helping someone, even
					if the situation has nothing to do with me or when it will delay my own activities.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>

			<p>My most recent passion project has been making the "Perfect Omelette."
				This project requires both logic and creativity/art.
				I balance them by knowing the process of making an omelette but also allowing for wiggle room
				when something isn't quite as "perfect" as it should be. "Perfect" is also subjective in this case.
				Different ingredients can make a perfect omelette for one person but a terrible omelette for another.
				I try to make it as aesthetically pleasing (for me) as possible while still maintaining the omelette style.</p>

			<h3>Golden Circle</h3>

			<p><strong>Why:</strong> Help expand the reach of local businesses</p>
			<p><strong>How:</strong> Using the LAMP stack to create these websites</p>
			<p><strong>What:</strong> Provide simple, low cost websites</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2> <br>

			<h3>Week One:</h3>
			<p>My first week at Deep Dive was very busy but also very fun. I have already learned so much and cannot wait to
			see what the next nine weeks hold for me. There have been times where I've looked at the amount of work yet to
				come and got a little nervous, but with knowing how much this course will benefit me, I know I will
			be just fine as long as I continue to use my time wisely and get all of the work done. I am excited to continue
			in this program and for all the possibilities this course will open up for me.</p>
