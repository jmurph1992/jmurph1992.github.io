			<h2>Pro Dev Activities</h2>

			<h3>Quantitative Accomplishments:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Monthly sales topped $50,000
				</li>
				<li>
					Spoken in front of crowds larger than 1,500
				</li>
				<li>
					Overseen the repair of 1000+ vehicles.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Qualitative features:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Detail Oriented:</strong> This can be a positive feature because it ensures that not even the smallest
					detail is overlooked, which can be very helpful. It can also be the cause of delays as the need
					to make things as good as possible sets in and it becomes difficult to leave something alone.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Thinker:</strong> This quality is useful because it helps me become aware of and be prepared for any
					issues that may arise. That can lead to a higher quality of work done. There can be a negative to this feature.
					In thinking too much, I have found that the more time I spend in preparation the later I get started on the rest of
					the project.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Friendly/Nice:</strong> This feature is a good one to have because it makes networking and making friends
					easier. I find it very easy to meet and talk to new people and that is a very good trait to have in this or any
					industry. Being too nice comes with some disadvantages.  I find it difficult to say no to helping someone, even
					if the situation has nothing to do with me or when it will delay my own activities.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>

			<p>My most recent passion project has been making the "Perfect Omelette."
				This project requires both logic and creativity/art.
				I balance them by knowing the process of making an omelette but also allowing for wiggle room
				when something isn't quite as "perfect" as it should be. "Perfect" is also subjective in this case.
				Different ingredients can make a perfect omelette for one person but a terrible omelette for another.
				I try to make it as aesthetically pleasing (for me) as possible while still maintaining the omelette style.</p>

			<h3>Golden Circle</h3>

			<p><strong>Why:</strong> Help expand the reach of local businesses</p>
			<p><strong>How:</strong> Using the LAMP stack to create these websites</p>
			<p><strong>What:</strong> Provide simple, low cost websites</p>

			<h3>Elevator Pitch:</h3>

			<p>Hi, my name is Justin. I create simple, low cost websites for local businesses that help to expand their reach.
				I'm using the LAMP stack to get these sites going. Do you support local business?</p>

			<h2>Visual Speaks</h2>

			<p><Strong>First Image:</Strong> I chose this cat as my first photo to demonstrate where I am at career wise because
				I have found that cats do not always have full control over their situation, but they sure do act like
				they do. Everything on the surface seems calm and collected but there are times that that is only a facade.
				Cats also land on their feet most of the times and that is how I like to look at my future possibilities, I'll
				land just as I am supposed to.</p>

			<p><strong>Second Image:</strong> I chose this picturesque mountain for my second image because it best represents
				where I would like to be in a couple of years: a mountain in the industry. For me, mountains have always been a
				symbol of potential and strength and those are qualities I'd like to bring with me into my career over the next
				many years. I can link these two images with hard work, dedication, and the skill I will be learning at Deep Dive.</p><br>

			<h2>Google Search:</h2>

			<p>Upon Googling myself, something became glaringly obvious. I need to work on my online presence and get the results
				that are actually about me further up in the search results. Currently, the only thing that shows up for me is
				my linked in page. I would ultimately like to see more items in the search results such as my Twitter, my GitHub,
				and eventually my Personal Web Page project. Having a small number of relevant search results may sound like a bad
				thing but I think I would rather have a small number of positive results than a large number of things I'm not
				very proud of showing up. It seems like it would be easier to build up a presence than deal with a bad online presence. </p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>

			<h3>Week One:</h3>
			<p>My first week at Deep Dive was very busy but also very fun. I have already learned so much and cannot wait to
				see what the next nine weeks hold for me. There have been times where I've looked at the amount of work yet to
				come and got a little nervous, but with knowing how much this course will benefit me, I know I will
				be just fine as long as I continue to use my time wisely and get all of the work done. I am excited to continue
				in this program and for all the possibilities this course will open up for me.</p> <br>

			<h3>Week Two:</h3>
			<p>Week two definitely picked up the pace for the cohort. There was a lof of new information and work thrown at us.
				Although it was more work and information than we have received so far, it was not overwhelming for me. I was really
				enjoying the amount of work and attention to detail everything needed. I can definitely see myself enjoying the
				work in the coming weeks. I discovered that when I have a lot of work to do is usually when I work best, I feel
				the urgency and importance of it all and that keeps me on track. I am looking forward to starting our capstone
				projects and for the rest of the Deep Dive experience.</p>
