			<h2>Pro Dev Activities</h2>

			<h3>Quantitative Accomplishments:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Monthly sales topped $50,000
				</li>
				<li>
					Spoken in front of crowds larger than 1,500
				</li>
				<li>
					Overseen the repair of 1000+ vehicles.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Qualitative features:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Detail Oriented:</strong> This can be a positive feature because it ensures that not even the smallest
					detail is overlooked, which can be very helpful. It can also be the cause of delays as the need
					to make things as good as possible sets in and it becomes difficult to leave something alone.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Thinker:</strong> This quality is useful because it helps me become aware of and be prepared for any
					issues that may arise. That can lead to a higher quality of work done. There can be a negative to this feature.
					In thinking too much, I have found that the more time I spend in preparation the later I get started on the rest of
					the project.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Friendly/Nice:</strong> This feature is a good one to have because it makes networking and making friends
					easier. I find it very easy to meet and talk to new people and that is a very good trait to have in this or any
					industry. Being too nice comes with some disadvantages.  I find it difficult to say no to helping someone, even
					if the situation has nothing to do with me or when it will delay my own activities.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>

			<p>My most recent passion project has been making the "Perfect Omelette."
				This project requires both logic and creativity/art.
				I balance them by knowing the process of making an omelette but also allowing for wiggle room
				when something isn't quite as "perfect" as it should be. "Perfect" is also subjective in this case.
				Different ingredients can make a perfect omelette for one person but a terrible omelette for another.
				I try to make it as aesthetically pleasing (for me) as possible while still maintaining the omelette style.</p>

			<h3>Golden Circle</h3>

			<p><strong>Why:</strong> Help expand the reach of local businesses</p>
			<p><strong>How:</strong> Using the LAMP stack to create these websites</p>
			<p><strong>What:</strong> Provide simple, low cost websites</p>

			<h3>Elevator Pitch:</h3>

			<p>Hi, my name is Justin. I create simple, low cost websites for local businesses that help to expand their reach.
				I'm using the LAMP stack to get these sites going. Do you support local business?</p>

			<h2>Visual Speaks</h2>

			<p><Strong>First Image:</Strong> I chose this cat as my first photo to demonstrate where I am at career wise because
				I have found that cats do not always have full control over their situation, but they sure do act like
				they do. Everything on the surface seems calm and collected but there are times that that is only a facade.
				Cats also land on their feet most of the times and that is how I like to look at my future possibilities, I'll
				land just as I am supposed to.</p>

			<p><strong>Second Image:</strong> I chose this picturesque mountain for my second image because it best represents
				where I would like to be in a couple of years: a mountain in the industry. For me, mountains have always been a
				symbol of potential and strength and those are qualities I'd like to bring with me into my career over the next
				many years. I can link these two images with hard work, dedication, and the skill I will be learning at Deep Dive.</p><br>

			<h2>Google Search:</h2>

			<p>Upon Googling myself, something became glaringly obvious. I need to work on my online presence and get the results
				that are actually about me further up in the search results. Currently, the only thing that shows up for me is
				my linked in page. I would ultimately like to see more items in the search results such as my Twitter, my GitHub,
				and eventually my Personal Web Page project. Having a small number of relevant search results may sound like a bad
				thing but I think I would rather have a small number of positive results than a large number of things I'm not
				very proud of showing up. It seems like it would be easier to build up a presence than deal with a bad online presence. </p>

			<h2>Forbidden Island Reflection:</h2>

			<p>We had a great time when we played Forbidden Island. The first thing we did was familiarize ourselves with the rules of the game.
				We kept the rules handy because it was our first time playing this game. Overall it went pretty smoothly. As a group we all communicated
				our intended next moves so we could discuss them as a group before actually making the moves. This helped us to beat the game.
				I found that each of us brought a new perspective to the game and each of us were making suggestions for the next move.
				Not one of us had no contributions to the victory and I believe that is why we were able to finish the game. We worked as a team
				and that lead us to victory.</p>

			<h2>Organization Search</h2>

			<p><strong>For-Profit:</strong> The organization I found is a local business called "Big Color Printing." I was unable to find any of their employees on
											LinkedIn. I chose this organization because when I was in high school as a member of the student government, we used to do business
											with them regularly and they were always very friendly and accommodating. The person I will attempt to make contact with
											is named Chris, no last name is listed. The listed email is "chris@bigcolorprinting.com" My strategy is to write and email expressing that I am a web
											developer and that I would like to offer my services for the maintenance of their web site.  The URL for their
											website is http://www.bigcolorprinting.com/ .</p>

			<p><strong>Non-Profit:</strong> The organization I found is called "New Mexico Animal Friends." I was unable to find anything on LinkedIn
											for this business as well. I chose this organization because I love animals and they are working hard to get
											animals into good, loving homes. No particular employees were listed, but I did find an email address: "info@nmaf.org" and
											a phone number of (505)881-7297. My strategy for reaching out to this organzation is to email and inform them
											that I am a web developer and noticed that their site was having problems displaying when not full screen and
											that I could help them out with that and more if they would like. The URL for this site is www.nmaf.org .</p>

			<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>

			<h3>Week One:</h3>
			<p>My first week at Deep Dive was very busy but also very fun. I have already learned so much and cannot wait to
				see what the next nine weeks hold for me. There have been times where I've looked at the amount of work yet to
				come and got a little nervous, but with knowing how much this course will benefit me, I know I will
				be just fine as long as I continue to use my time wisely and get all of the work done. I am excited to continue
				in this program and for all the possibilities this course will open up for me.</p> <br>

			<h3>Week Two:</h3>
			<p>Week two definitely picked up the pace for the cohort. There was a lof of new information and work thrown at us.
				Although it was more work and information than we have received so far, it was not overwhelming for me. I was really
				enjoying the amount of work and attention to detail everything needed. I can definitely see myself enjoying the
				work in the coming weeks. I discovered that when I have a lot of work to do is usually when I work best, I feel
				the urgency and importance of it all and that keeps me on track. I am looking forward to starting our capstone
				projects and for the rest of the Deep Dive experience.</p> <br>

			<h3>Week Three:</h3>
			<p>Things are definitely getting more intense in class. This week we were introduced to our Capstone groups and projects.
				I really enjoy both of the group members I was assigned. I think we will be able to create a project that will be functional
				and beautiful. The pace of work has only picked up since last week. I find that I am getting both nervous and excited to tackle
				the remaining 7 weeks of the boot camp. I have been speaking with people I know that have also taken a boot camp and found it
				to be very reassuring. To learn that they were having the same feelings of nervousness, excitement, and stress really bring
				a nice sense of peace to my brain. I trust that if I just keep working hard that I will be just fine for the rest of the
				boot camp.</p> <br>

			<h3>Week Four:</h3>
			<p>Week 4 was a good week. We made it through our first sprint in our capstone projects! Everything has been going well. I am starting
				to see all the content coming together. Understanding the content is very important to me and seeing how all the different things we
				have been working on come together and make a functional website is very exciting. I have been starting to think about what steps are
				necesary to get me where I want to go career wise and I will be making small steps in my spare time towards making my goals a reality.
				I am looking forward to meeting with the career coach and the instructors to check in with where I'm at and get/give some feedback about
				my experience so far. I look forward to week 5 and beyond.</p> <br>

			<h3>Week Five:</h3>
			<p>Week 5 was the beginning of Sprint two for our capstone projects. The biggest item on the list for sprint 2 tasks was the unit
			testing. The actual writing of the test was not as bad as the thought of it. Once I figured out setting it up, it was not so bad.
			Another thing I enjoyed working on in week 5 was my personal web page. My web page is coming together nicely. There are still a few
			design elements I'm trying to decide on but overall, it is looking great!</p> <br>

			<h3>Week Six:</h3>
			<p>Week 6 saw us finishing one of our unit tests while we are still fixing errors on the other two. Getting the first unit test to
			pass was a very exciting thing. Now that we know how to navigate the murky waters of the unit test, we can make the next two tests
			a little bit easier.  During week 6 we also got the contact form on our personal web pages up and running. That was a very confusing
			process but in the end it was all working as it was supposed to. I think the knowledge that we only have 4 weeks left is really starting to
			set in. With that comes a whole new set of things to prepare and worry about. I imagine things will be getting pretty busy and hectic. I look
			forward to seeing what challenges these remaining weeks bring and I also look forward to getting the capstone and personal web page projects
			completed and ready to show off.</p> <br>
